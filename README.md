## Sentiment Analysis
In this repo, I have tried to create a simple RNN model for sentiment Analysis on the imdb dataset that is available in keras
### Model
The way model is trained is available in simple-rnn.ipynb file
### Saving the model
After we have trained the model, we should save it to use it in the web that. You should save it as a .keras file type
### Web App
The web app that I have created for the system which is simple, is in the main.py file
